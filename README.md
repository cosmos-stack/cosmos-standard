# COSMOSLOOPS/Cosmos.Standard

Cosmos.Standard is the core repository of [COSMOS LOOPS PROGRAMME](https://github.com/cosmos-loops). This repository providers a lot of utilities, helpers and extensions to make developers more efficient in their work. Whether it's developing .NET Framework Applications or .NET Core Applications, Cosmos.Standard or each member project in it will give you a silky feel. I believe in the near future, this project (COSMOS LOOPS PROGRAMME) will become more exciting.
